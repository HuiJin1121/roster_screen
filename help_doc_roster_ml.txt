
1. why isnot the orginal model appropriate for your database.
    
    there are 3 points to build good deep neural network models.
    
    - Big database
    -traing technology such optimision,paramater tunning...
    - model architecture.

      the relation between Big database and model architecture  is as follows.
	
        when you train the model with your database
        
         model is not prepare for train data, not for test data => model has low capacity(underfitting).
         model is prepare for train data,not for test data => modle has high capacity(overfitting).
      
       it is very important to decide the model's capacity.
      
       The architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers (depth) and the number of neurons in each layer (width), affects its capacity. 
       Deeper networks with more layers tend to have higher capacity as they can learn hierarchical representations of the data. 
       Wider networks with more neurons per layer also have increased capacity as they can capture more complex patterns.

       in your task you cann't improve the performance because model has low capacity.
      
       when compare model with your database size i think model capacity is 1.
       At least model capacity has to have 5.
       So model's complexity has added => need more layers,more parameters...
       ...

2. To get good model.

   there are many  existing deep neural network models such as  resnet,densenet,conv1net,transformer...
    
   -time series processing using transformer

    # Attention and Normalization
    x = layers.MultiHeadAttention(
        key_dim=head_size, num_heads=num_heads, dropout=dropout
    )(inputs, inputs)
    x = layers.Dropout(dropout)(x)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(x)
    res = x + inputs

    # Feed Forward Part
    x = layers.Conv1D(filters=ff_dim, kernel_size=1, activation="relu")(res)
    x = layers.Dropout(dropout)(x)
    x = layers.Conv1D(filters=inputs.shape[-1], kernel_size=1)(x)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(x)
    return x + res

    input_shape,

    num_heads,
    ff_dim,
    num_transformer_blocks,
    mlp_units,
    dropout=0,
    mlp_dropout=0,
):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = inputs
    for _ in range(num_transformer_blocks):
        x = transformer_encoder(x, head_size, num_heads, ff_dim, dropout)

    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(data_format="channels_last")(x)
    for dim in mlp_units:
        x = layers.Dense(dim, activation="relu")(x)
        x = layers.Dropout(mlp_dropout)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(n_classes, activation="softmax")(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
